# `/auth/me` we want to return the userâ€™s identifier and email along
# with their role objects and computed permission strings.  Returning
# the full user record with permissions in a single call makes it
# straightforward for the frontend AuthContext to populate roles and
# permissions without needing to reconcile disparate structures.

    Extends the base ``UserResponse`` with the roles and permissions
    lists.  ``UserResponse`` already includes all of the standard
    user fields (id, full_name, email, phone, status flags, etc.).
    ``roles`` is a list of ``RoleResponse`` objects and ``permissions``
    is a list of permission strings.  This shape aligns with the
    frontend ``User`` type used in the AuthContext.
