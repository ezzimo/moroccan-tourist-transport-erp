# Moroccan Tourist Transport ERP - Testing and Debug Report

**Date:** July 26, 2025  
**Tester:** Senior Full-Stack Testing Expert (AI Agent)  
**Focus:** Authentication Microservice APIs and Frontend Integration  

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive testing and debugging process performed on the Moroccan Tourist Transport ERP web application, with specific focus on the authentication microservice and its integration with the React frontend. Multiple critical issues were identified and resolved, significantly improving the system's reliability and functionality.

## System Architecture Overview

The application consists of:
- **Backend:** FastAPI-based microservices architecture
- **Frontend:** React application with TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for authentication service
- **Cache:** Redis for session management
- **Containerization:** Docker Compose for orchestration
- **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx for API routing

## Issues Identified and Resolved




### 1. Docker Compose Configuration Issues

**Issue:** Missing health checks and dependency management
**Impact:** Services starting before dependencies are ready
**Resolution:**
- Added health checks for PostgreSQL and Redis services
- Configured proper service dependencies with `depends_on` and `condition: service_healthy`
- Updated auth service environment file reference from `.env.example` to `.env`

**Files Modified:**
- `docker-compose.yml`: Added health checks and dependency management

### 2. Frontend API Client Configuration

**Issue:** Missing named export for `apiClient`
**Impact:** Build failures due to import errors in other modules
**Resolution:**
- Added both default and named exports for `apiClient`
- Enhanced API client with comprehensive request/response logging
- Improved error handling and token refresh logic

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/api/client.ts`: Added named export and debug logging

### 3. Nginx Proxy Configuration

**Issue:** Nginx configuration was correct but needed verification
**Status:** ✅ Working correctly
**Verification:** Direct curl tests to `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login` return successful responses

**Files Verified:**
- `frontend/nginx.conf`: Properly configured to proxy `/api/v1/auth/` to `auth_service:8000`

### 4. Backend Authentication Service

**Issue:** UserResponse validation error in login endpoint
**Impact:** Login requests failing with validation errors
**Resolution:**
- Fixed UserResponse model validation in auth service
- Enhanced health check endpoint with database and Redis connectivity tests
- Corrected environment file configuration

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/main.py`: Fixed UserResponse validation and enhanced health checks
- `backend/app/services/auth_service.py`: Fixed response model validation

### 5. Database and Test Data

**Issue:** No test users available for authentication testing
**Resolution:**
- Created test user script to generate properly hashed passwords
- Successfully created test user: `ahmed@example.com` with password `SecurePassword123!`
- Verified user creation in PostgreSQL database

**Files Created:**
- `create_test_user.py`: Script for creating test users with proper password hashing

## Critical Discovery: Browser Caching Issue

### Root Cause Identified

**Primary Issue:** Browser caching of old JavaScript files
**Evidence:**
- HTML file loads `index-DzogLH5V.js` (new version with fixes)
- Browser console shows errors from `index-CjVjcZRt.js` (old cached version)
- Direct fetch API calls work perfectly (status 200, correct response)
- Frontend application login fails with `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`

**Technical Analysis:**
1. **API Proxy Working:** ✅ Confirmed via curl tests
2. **Backend Services Working:** ✅ Confirmed via direct API calls
3. **Database Connectivity:** ✅ Confirmed via health checks
4. **Frontend Build:** ✅ New files generated correctly
5. **Browser Cache:** ❌ Loading old JavaScript with problematic code

### Verification Tests Performed

#### Backend API Tests
```bash
# Health check - SUCCESS
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Response: {"status":"healthy","database":"connected","redis":"connected"}

# Direct auth service login - SUCCESS  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"ahmed@example.com","password":"SecurePassword123!"}'
# Response: {"access_token":"...","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":3600,"user":{...}}
```

#### Frontend Proxy Tests
```bash
# Nginx proxy test - SUCCESS
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"ahmed@example.com","password":"SecurePassword123!"}'
# Response: {"access_token":"...","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":3600,"user":{...}}
```

#### Browser Direct API Test
```javascript
// Direct fetch in browser console - SUCCESS
fetch('/api/v1/auth/login', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({email:'ahmed@example.com',password:'SecurePassword123!'})
})
// Response: Status 200, successful login data
```

## Current System Status

### ✅ Working Components
- Docker Compose orchestration with health checks
- PostgreSQL database with test user data
- Redis cache service
- Authentication service backend APIs
- Nginx proxy configuration
- API endpoint routing and responses

### ❌ Remaining Issues
- **Browser Cache:** Old JavaScript files being served
- **Frontend Login:** Application-level login failing due to cached code

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Fix: Clear Browser Cache
1. **Hard Refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (attempted, partially successful)
2. **Clear Browser Data:** Clear all cached data for localhost:3000
3. **Incognito Mode:** Test in private browsing mode
4. **Different Browser:** Test with different browser

### Long-term Solutions
