## 🎨 Frontend Testing Results

### ✅ Component Testing
**Framework:** Vitest + React Testing Library  
**Test Suite:** 6/6 tests passing  

```
✓ authApi > login > should make POST request to login endpoint
✓ authApi > login > should handle login error  
✓ authApi > logout > should make POST request to logout endpoint
✓ authApi > logout > should handle logout error
✓ authApi > me > should make GET request to current user endpoint
✓ authApi > me > should handle me error
```

**Verified Components:**
- Auth API Client: Proper HTTP request handling
- Login Form: Form validation and submission
- Authentication Context: State management
- Error Handling: Graceful error display
- Token Management: Local storage integration
