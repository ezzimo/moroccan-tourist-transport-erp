The conversation has focused on developing a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system for Moroccan tourist transport companies, adopting a microservices architecture. The core technology stack for these services consistently includes FastAPI, SQLModel, and PostgreSQL, with Redis being utilized for specific functionalities like OTP and real-time notifications. Each microservice is designed with modularity, robust security features, and adherence to best practices, including dependency injection, comprehensive testing, and Dockerization for ease of deployment.

To date, three distinct microservices have been successfully outlined and detailed. Initially, an Authentication & Authorization Microservice was established, providing JWT-based login/logout, OTP verification, and a granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for managing users, roles, and permissions. This foundational service ensures secure access and authorization across the ERP.

Following this, a Tour Operations Microservice was developed, enabling the management of reusable tour templates, operational tour instances, detailed itineraries, and real-time incident reporting, with capabilities for resource assignment and push notifications. Most recently, a Fleet Management Microservice was detailed, covering vehicle inventory, preventive maintenance scheduling, compliance tracking, vehicle assignments to tours, and comprehensive fuel and document management. Each microservice is designed to integrate seamlessly with the others, forming a cohesive ERP ecosystem tailored to the specific needs of the Moroccan tourist transport industry.
